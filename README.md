# The Seattle Podcast List
This  repo contains the code and resources that generate the Seattle Podcast List. 
This is a list of the podcasts being produced in the Seattle metropolitan area. We would like this list of Seattle podcasts to be as complete as possible. Any podcast in Seattle or anywhere nearby can be added. [Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome](https://github.com/jrigden/seattlepodcasters.com/issues). You can also DM Jason on Twitter: [@mr_rigden](https://twitter.com/mr_rigden) If there are similar lists for Portland or Vancouver, we would love to link to them.
