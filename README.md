# Seattle Podcast List

This is a list of the podcasts being produced in the Seattle metropolitan area. I would like this list to be as complete as possible.  Any podcast in Seattle or anywhere nearby can be added.  [Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome.](https://github.com/jrigden/seattle-podcast-list/issues "Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome.")  If there are similar lists for Portland or Vancouver, I would love to link to them.
